# Handwritten-Digit-Classification
This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset and Machine Learning techniques. The model learns to classify grayscale images of digits (0–9) by extracting numerical patterns from pixel data and predicting the correct digit label.
The workflow covers data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and performance analysis. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate fundamental concepts of computer vision and supervised learning using a standard benchmark dataset.
